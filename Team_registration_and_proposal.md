### The tentative project title:

Understanding the Impact of Active Design on Physical Activity and
Transportation in New York City

### The motivation for this project:

New York City’s efforts to enhance public health through urban design,
transportation infrastructure, and active living environments are
crucial for promoting physical activity, reducing transportation-related
injuries, and improving community health outcomes. By analyzing
walkability, physical activity rates, commuting modes, and
transportation-related injuries, this project aims to understand how
active design principles contribute to or hinder public health in NYC
neighborhoods. This project is motivated by a need to identify urban
design factors that effectively promote health, safety, and well-being
across diverse communities in NYC.

### The intended final products:(need to be edited later)

This project will generate a comprehensive report that includes data
analysis, findings, and policy recommendations. This report will cover:

- Descriptive summaries of walkability, physical activity,
  transportation modes, and injury rates across NYC neighborhoods.

- Correlations and associations between these indicators, with insights
  into how urban design impacts health and safety.

- Geospatial visualization showing the distribution of walkability,
  physical activity levels, commuting methods, and injury rates across
  NYC neighborhoods.

- Recommendations for urban planning and public health policy based on
  the findings, targeting specific NYC neighborhoods or boroughs.

### The anticipated data sources:

We will be using the environment and health data published by
[nyc.gov](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-explorer/)

### The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1.  **Data Cleaning and Integration**
    - Standardize variable names, data types, and formats across
      multiple datasets (active design, physical activity, socioeconomic
      indicators, transportation modes, injury data, and health
      outcomes).
    - Merge datasets by common identifiers, such as geographic
      boundaries (borough, neighborhood), and time (if available).
    - Handle missing data and potential outliers by implementing data
      imputation or exclusion criteria to maintain data quality.
2.  **Statistical Analysis**
    - Calculate summary statistics (mean, median, range) for each
      indicator within boroughs and neighborhoods to provide an overview
      of the data distribution.
    - Generate correlation matrices for key indicators to explore
      relationships between walkability, physical activity, and injury
      rates.
    - Carry out regression analysis to examine the relationships between
      walkability and key health outcomes, such as physical activity
      levels and transportation-related injuries.
3.  **Visualization**
    - Map the distribution of key indicators like walkability scores,
      physical activity levels, and transportation-related injuries
      across NYC boroughs and neighborhoods.
    - Conduct a hotspot analysis and develop heatmaps to identify areas
      with particularly high or low walkability, activity levels, or
      injury rates.
4.  **Coding Challenges**
    - The data wrangling is complex, as it involves linking multiple
      large datasets from different sources. They may have varying
      formats, missing values, and inconsistent naming conventions.
      Merging and standardizing these datasets for analysis can be
      time-consuming and error-prone.
    - Working with geospatial data (e.g., neighborhood boundaries)
      requires accurate geographic information for correct mapping.
    - Including many predictors may lead to multicollinearity, making it
      difficult to interpret model coefficients and reducing model
      stability.

#### Planned analyses:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Our first step will involve rigorous
data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure accuracy and usability. This
will include handling missing values, verifying the accuracy of the
location data, and standardizing restroom facility attributes (such as
accessibility features and hours of operation) for consistent analysis.

Geospatial Analysis: We plan to perform geospatial analysis to identify
areas within NYC that are underserved by public restroom facilities. By
integrating the restroom data with maps and demographic information, we
can highlight neighborhoods where improvements are needed, potentially
influencing urban planning and accessibility efforts.

Usage Patterns and Predictive Modelling: We aim to analyze patterns of
restroom availability and predict potential high-demand areas. This
could involve temporal analysis to understand peak times and seasons for
restroom usage, helping tourists and locals plan their outings more
effectively.

#### Visualization:

Heatmaps of Restroom Availability: To illustrate restroom density and
accessibility, we will create heatmaps that show how well different
parts of the city are served. This visualization will help identify
“restroom deserts” and can be used for advocacy and planning. Demand
Forecast Graphs: Using predictive models, we will create graphs that
forecast restroom demand across different times and areas, helping to
manage and plan for peak times.

#### Coding challenges:

Creating an intuitive for the interactive maps and other tools poses a
significant challenge.
